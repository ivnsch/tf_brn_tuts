# Intro

These tutorials are a port of the [Tensorflow's Python tutorials](), aiming at idiomatic Rust and Burn usage.

The basic idea is: "hey, you can do this in Rust too, and here's how".

For now this is totally experimental: primarily to learn, while reasonable efforts are being made, there are no guarantees on correctness, performance or completeness. Only one tutorial is currently planned. Contributions are welcome.
