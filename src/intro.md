# Intro

These tutorials are a port of the [Tensorflow's Python tutorials](), aiming at idiomatic Rust and Burn usage.

The idea is: "hey, you can do this in Rust too, and here's how".

This is a learning project: while reasonable efforts are being made, there are no guarantees on correctness, performance or completeness. Only one tutorial is currently planned. Contributions are welcome.

Aside of porting and related explanations, unless there's a need for improvement, the original explanations will be simply copied. This avoids unnecessary work and helps to orient more easily if following both tutorials.
